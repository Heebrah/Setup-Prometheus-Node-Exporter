Those look like **Prometheus Node Exporter metrics**, each representing a different aspect of system performance:

---

### **1️⃣ `node_network_receive_bytes_total`**

* **What it is:**
  Cumulative count of **bytes** received over all network interfaces since the system started.
* **Type:** Counter (keeps increasing until reboot or interface reset).
* **Use case:**
  Monitor incoming network traffic, detect spikes, or track total bandwidth usage.
* **Example query (rate over 5 minutes):**

  ```promql
  rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total[5m])
  ```
---

### **2️⃣ `node_filesystem_avail_bytes`**

* **What it is:**
  Number of **bytes available** to non-root users on a filesystem.
* **Type:** Gauge (can go up or down).
* **Use case:**
  Check disk free space, alert if nearing low thresholds.
* **Example alert rule:**

  ```promql
  node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/"} < 5 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024
  ```

  *(alerts if less than 5 GB free on `/`)*

---

### **3️⃣ `node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes`** *(I think you meant this, not `MemAvailability_bytes`)*

* **What it is:**
  An estimate of memory available for starting new applications without swapping.
* **Type:** Gauge.
* **Use case:**
  Detect low memory conditions before swap usage spikes.
* **Example alert rule:**

  ```promql
  node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes < 500 * 1024 * 1024
  ```

  *(alerts if available memory < 500 MB)*

---

If you want, I can write you a **Prometheus alerting rules YAML** that triggers when:

* Network receive rate is unusually high.
* Disk space is low.
* Memory availability drops below a threshold.

That would tie these three metrics together into actionable monitoring.
